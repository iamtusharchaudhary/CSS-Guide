# What is CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.<br>

# CSS Margins
The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.
With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).
# CSS has properties for specifying the margin for each side of an element:
1. margin-top
2. margin-right
3. margin-bottom
4. margin-left

# Example:-
p {
  margin-top: 100px;
  margin-bottom: 100px;
  margin-right: 150px;
  margin-left: 80px;
}
